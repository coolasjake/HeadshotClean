Fix:
'DONE' - Make 'Impacts' move accurate
- Change Distance limitations in LaserMiner to be on the raycast in LookingEnemy instead.
- When close to a moving enemy and invisible, the head will jiggle (probably caused by 'look around' rapidly turning on and off)
- Switch gravity impact kill to effect 'shooteables' and use damage.
- Bug where gravity is locked in half gravity (normal direction). Doesnt respond to any inputs, but is 'fixed' when the gravity meter runs out.
- UnCrouching will cause you to crouch again if the next collision is an Impact, even if it is a long time after.
'DONE' - Figure out why phase breaks (probably a temporary object created by the player or an enemy eg alarm).

'DONE' - When Gravity is directly 'up', pressing the Gravity button while aiming at the surface you are standing on will cause Gravity to revert to normal.
'DONE' - When landing on a surface, sometimes the Gyroscope wont change to the new Gravity.
- When using C to reset gravity, and hitting the ground at the same (or similar) time, gravity will change to down, but the player wont rotate.
- When very close to a wall but aiming at the furthest point of it from the player, gravity sometimes (~50%) stays down while the player rotates.
- Phase gauntlet 'Rooms' have extra walls that should be deleted.
'DONE' - Complete shedule enemy: all systems have been created but something is stopping it from working. POSSIBLY - schedule is using local positions, and the Agent cant find a path, so resets to current position.

Important/Easy:
- Add a visual demonstrating (more clearly) the strength of gravity, so that custom gravity is intuitive.

Features:
'DONE' - Change 'Can see player when searching' to 'has expanded DetectionAngle when searching'. [The bots will now become aware of you if you are in front of them, and quickly turn to face you, but not instantly]
'DONE' - Add 'Body detection', so that enemies go into searching mode when seeing a dead body.
'DONE' - Make the bots look around when the player has been 'lost'.
'DONE' - Add 'Sound', so nearby enemies are aware of gunshots.
'DONE' - Create resource meters
'DONE' - Attach meters to abilities
'DONE' - Set up resource systems for abilities (and do basic balancing)
'SORTOF' - Build quest system
	'DONE' - Finish linking indicators and sub objectives
	'DONE' - Create Objective class, with SO interaction
	'DONE' - Create the Quest class, with a method for displaying them, and Objectives management
	'DONE' - Finish the Quest Manager (basic functionality)
	'DONE' - Create a (test) enemy that generates a quest to destroy it when spawned
	'DONE' - Make a test 'reach this area' quest (maybe a racecourse?)
	- Create UI to display quests
- Create a quest log
- 'DONE' Add 'power cells'
- Add basic 'work' for the bots to do (patrol, laser ceiling/side of building, ...)
- Make different enemies
	- Flying???
	- Tractor beam enemies
	- Power-drain projectiles (sombra hack on huge sym orbs)
	- Face Shields
	- Hunters with better AI, 'sensors', weapons etc
	- Guards with projectile weapons

Improve:
'DONE' - Make 'Alarm' happen at more natural times (eg if player is 'obvious', they are probably not hiding, so shoot instead of alarm).
- Make second or third enemy sound alarm, like in Shadow of Mordor, as every 'individual enemy' shouldnt sound the alarm, just medium sized groups.
- Test new gravity control scheme where pressing F makes the direction you are pointing 'Down', and holding F makes any surface your feet touch 'Level'.
- Ability Failed SFX.
- Investigate 'reverse quaternion'.



JONNY DEADLINE:
- Change current audio to use audio managers.
- Add more SFX like different sounds for abilities and sounds for failed abilities.
- Finish AT LEAST one phase section/puzzle.
- 

- Finish tutorial
- Make small open-world area decent


FINISH THE GAME STEPS:
- Create different walls
	- 'DONE' Gravity-safe, phase-proof, window, spike, visor, normal.
	- 'DONE' Grill (can teleport through, and sortof see through)
	- 'DONE' Let enemies see through windows.
	- 'DONE' Die when hitting a spike.
- Create Guantlets
	- 'DONE' Stealth 'NEEDS IMPROVEMENT'
	- Gravity
	- Phase
	- Teleport
- Create more enemies (that look different)
- Create transition

IMPORTANT FIXES:
- Balance gun + abilities (i.e. phase should kill you faster, regen rates)
- Phase is always accurate AND can detect when only inside an enemy.
- Enemies do the 'random fire' if the player goes round a corner (should only happen when invisible).


REMEMBER REMEMBER:
- Without deep knowledge of quaternians, gravity MUST be changed with the LookRotation, down is forwards method.
-- Rotating to face, then about x-axis, then turning back performs the same job as LookRotation, but less accurately. Dont use it.



5/11:
- Dropped floor in gravity trial
- Made most of shedule enemy + schedule (not working, see 'Fix:')

6/11:
- Finished Schedule Enemy
- Added patrol and schedule enemies to castle (could use some normal laser miners)
